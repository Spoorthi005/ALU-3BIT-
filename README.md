# ALU-3BIT-
An arithmetic-logic unit is the part of a central processing unit that carries out arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words. Arithmetic logic units are integral to nearly every computing system capable of processing data.
Arithmetic operations
Add: A and B are summed and the sum appears at Y and carry-out.
Add with carry: A, B and carry-in are summed and the sum appears at Y and carry-out.
Subtract: B is subtracted from A (or vice versa) and the difference appears at Y and carry-out. For this function, carry-out is effectively a "borrow" indicator. This operation may also be used to compare the magnitudes of A and B; in such cases the Y output may be ignored by the processor, which is only interested in the status bits (particularly zero and negative) that result from the operation.
Subtract with borrow: B is subtracted from A (or vice versa) with borrow (carry-in) and the difference appears at Y and carry-out (borrow out).
Two's complement: A (or B) is subtracted from zero and the difference appears at Y.
Increment: A (or B) is increased by one and the resulting value appears at Y.
Decrement: A (or B) is decreased by one and the resulting value appears at Y.
Bitwise logical operations
AND: the bitwise AND of A and B appears at Y.
OR: the bitwise OR of A and B appears at Y.
Exclusive-OR: the bitwise XOR of A and B appears at Y.
Ones' complement: all bits of A (or B) are inverted and appear at Y.
